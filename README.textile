h1. Ruby-Shout

h2. Purpose

ruby-shout lets you send compressed audio over the network to an "Icecast":http://www.icecast.org/ streaming media server.

h2. Requirements

libshout 2.0, available from "icecast.org":http://www.icecast.org/download.php. libshout 2 requires the ogg and vorbis libraries.

h2. Summary of usage

This extension follows python-shout fairly closely. You make a Shout object with Shout.new, set its properties, tell it to connect, then send blocks of data, sync and repeat. Disconnect when done.

h2. Usage

See example.rb. Run it like

  ./example.rb test/test.mp3

h2. Todo

* proper unit tests (blush)

h2. History & Credits

* 2001 Jared Jenning built the initial version for libshout 1
* 2003 Jared Jenning rebuilt ruby-shout for libshout 2 and maintained it to until 2005
* Yauhen Kharuzhy helped with bugfixes and initial metadata support
* 2010 "Overlay" (real name unknown to me) patched ruby-shout for ruby 1.9 support, Diego Elio "Flameeyes" Petten√≤ "incorporated patch into the gentoo package":http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-ruby/ruby-shout/files/ruby-shout-2.1%2Bruby-1.9.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup. It got removed later on due to "some issues":http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-ruby/ruby-shout/files/ruby-shout-2.1%2Bruby-1.9.patch?view=markup.
* 2010 Niko Dittman re-added the patch and fixed the issues. See "Recent Changes" for details.

h2. Recent Changes

* Included the "ruby 1.9 patch":http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-ruby/ruby-shout/files/ruby-shout-2.1%2Bruby-1.9.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup although it seems to have "some issues":http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-ruby/ruby-shout/files/ruby-shout-2.1%2Bruby-1.9.patch?view=log. I hope to have fixed the issues with this:
* Replaced STR2CSTR for StringValuePtr as STR2CSTR doesn't work for 1.9 any more
* Added format = Shout::MP3 to the example as this is absolutely needed by the latest versions of libshout.
* Added an integration test which builds and installs the gem and plays some sound on a local icecast server. I mainly did that because the old version of ruby-shout didn't even compile for ruby 1.9. Run with:

  rake test:integration

h2. State

I tested this version of ruby-shout to build and run on

* ruby-1.9.1-p378 [x86_64] OSX 10.6
