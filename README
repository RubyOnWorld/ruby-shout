TO INSTALL
----------

ruby extconf.rb
make
sudo make install 

if you didn't use raa-install.

REQUIRES
--------
libshout 2.0, available from icecast.org. libshout 2 requires the ogg
and vorbis libraries.

SUMMARY
-------
This extension follows python-shout fairly closely. You make a Shout
object with Shout.new, set its properties, tell it to connect, then
send blocks of data, sync and repeat. Disconnect when done. There is
no #open with a block as there is for a File or Socket: maybe later. 

LICENSE
-------
You may not yet redistribute ruby-shout. Use it for yourself and wait
for me to paste in a BSD-like license here.
